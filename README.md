# Heart Disease Prediction System using Logistic Regression
## Overview
This project aims to develop a Heart Disease Prediction System utilizing Logistic Regression, a statistical method widely used for binary classification tasks. The system is designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various input features.
## Features
•Utilizes Logistic Regression algorithm for prediction.

•Input features include but are not limited to age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant health indicators.

•Provides accurate predictions based on the trained model.

•Easy-to-use interface for entering input data and obtaining predictions.

### Installation
1.Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Hamoodi79/Heart-Disease-Prediction-System.git

2.Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage
1.Run the main script: python heart_disease_prediction.py

2.Enter the required input features when prompted.

3.Obtain the prediction for heart disease likelihood.

## Dataset
The system is trained on a dataset containing historical health data with corresponding heart disease outcomes. The dataset used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository.
